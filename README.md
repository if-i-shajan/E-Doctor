# E-Doctor: A Digital Medical Consultation System

## Problem Statement
Healthcare access is often limited due to availability issues and long waiting times. Patients frequently need quick guidance on their symptoms and possible medications before consulting a doctor. Many rural areas lack access to medical professionals, making early self-assessment a necessity.

### Objectives
The E-Doctor system aims to provide:
- Basic medical information
- Symptom-based disease suggestions
- Recommended medications
- Assistance for healthcare workers and pharmacies in identifying common illnesses

## System Overview
The E-Doctor system functions as an information storage and retrieval platform for basic medical consultations. Users can input symptoms, and the system will suggest possible conditions and associated medications.

### Core Functionalities
- **Symptom Analysis**: Users can enter symptoms to get relevant disease information.
- **Medicine Recommendation**: Based on stored data, the system suggests appropriate medicines.
- **Disease Database**: A structured storage of diseases, symptoms, and treatments.
- **Data Management**: Medical information will be updated through class-based file handling.
- **User Management**: Patients can access stored information, while admins can update medical records.

## Technical Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: Java Collections, Java I/O for file handling
- **Development Tools**: Apache NetBeans, JDK 23
- **Database**: File-based storage (Text files), with potential for database integration in future versions

## Object-Oriented Design Aspects
- **Classes and Objects**: Separate classes for Users, Symptoms, Diseases, and Medicines.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Parent class `MedicalInfo` with specialized child classes.
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Interface for User Roles (Admin & Patient), Abstract Class for Disease Information.
- **Exception Handling**: Handling invalid inputs, missing data, and file errors.
- **Multithreading and Concurrency**: Allowing concurrent user access for data retrieval.
- **GUI (Optional)**: Basic graphical interface for user interaction, allowing users to input symptoms and retrieve results.

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App Integration**: Extending accessibility to mobile users.
- **Cloud Storage Support**: For centralized and real-time data management.
- **Multilingual Support**: To cater to a wider audience.
- **Integration with Healthcare Systems**: To allow doctors to provide remote consultations.

## Conclusion
This project will serve as a digital reference for users seeking preliminary medical guidance. By implementing OOP principles, file-based data management, and networking capabilities, the E-Doctor system will provide a structured and efficient way to access medical information. Future developments can further enhance its usability, making healthcare information more accessible to everyone.
